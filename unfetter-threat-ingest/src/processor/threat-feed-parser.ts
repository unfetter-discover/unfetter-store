/**
 * Threat feed parsers read in data from a feed that is expected to follow a certain type, such as XML. They can be
 * strict or lenient. The result is that they return data in a Report JSON format (see interface).
 * 
 * If someone has unique parsing needs, even if the content of the feed matches an existing parser, such as XML, they
 * should create a new parser, with a distinct type (say, 'xml-myfeed', or whatever unique name you like), and set
 * the feed configuration to use that new type. An example of a custom parser would be knowing that a particular feed
 * provides associations to existing STIX objects, and adds relationships
 * 
 * Parsers are automatically loaded. First, the system will check the processor directory and any subdirectories. That
 * directory will contain "standard" parsers. The simple XML parser is one. Next, it will search for a dist/plugins
 * directory and any subdirectories. That directory does not normally exist, but site deployments of the service should
 * feel free to inject such a path with whatever custom parsers you need.
 * 
 * There is currently no means to associate reports with other STIX data. So a report that is relevant to certain
 * malware or attack patterns cannot have those relationships ingested along with it. This is something we really
 * need to address, possibly modifying the report definition to include a relationships list.
